# ciphertool
Currently a basic polyalphabetic substitution cipher. This tool turns small sections of text into an unreadable encrypted format,
which can then be deciphered. However, the text is vulnreable to letter frequency attacks.

Depends on lua, works best and tested on lua5.3

Debian installation:

sudo apt install lua5.3
